# Your Favorite Place

In this assignment, you'll be creating a single page travel website using HTML and CSS for your favorite place. 
This place can be real or fictional. The goal of this website should help a new traveler to this place quickly 
understand local customs and prepare them for a trip.

In part 1, your focus will be on writing valid, semantic HTML for the content of your website. In part 2, you 
will use the wireframes and mockup of your recipe to add images and write CSS for the website. Your goal is 
to keep the proper semantics of the HTML, while doing your best to acheive what you mocked up. You will have 
two weeks to write the CSS and lots of class time, so challenge yourself with a fun design!

## Requirements: Part 1

- [ ] All HTML is valid.
- [ ] Your website includes a title using an h1 tag.
- [ ] Your website includes at least one introduction paragraph.
- [ ] Your website includes a list of top attractions in order, using the ol tag.
- [ ] Your website includes a list of tips in no particular order, using the ul tag.
- [ ] Your website includes a helpful link using an a tag.
- [ ] The order of your recipe content makes sense and reads easily. It is not reordered to accommodate your desktop layout, and could be read by a screen reader from top to bottom.
- [ ] All HTML tags are semantic, and divs/spans are avoided where possible. Try to use the section tag instead to group related content.
- [ ] No heading levels are skipped - you used h1, h2, h3, etc in the correct order. (It's okay to use multiple of the same heading if they are the same level of importance.)
- [ ] Formatting, including indentation, spacing, etc, is consistent and easy to read.
- [ ] If you used AI assistance, you have sourced it using an HTML comment. (`<!-- This is how you write a comment in HTML. -->`)

## Requirements: Part 2

- [ ] Your code still meets the requirements in Part 1.
- [ ] All CSS is valid.
- [ ] There is no inline CSS or CSS in style tags.
- [ ] Your CSS selectors use classes, not IDs.
- [ ] Your CSS classes are named in a way that's easy for another developer to read and understand.
- [ ] Your specificity is minimal, so other developers can easily override your CSS if needed later on.
- [ ] Your design renders consistently in the most recent version of Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. (You can use https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser to test this if you don't have them installed.)
- [ ] The finished product looks roughly like your mockup, minus any interactivity, animation, or functionality that might require JavaScript.
