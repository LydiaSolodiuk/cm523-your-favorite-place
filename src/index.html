		<li>For a more exciting experience, plan to visit the Freedom Trail on a day when there are historical
			reenactments or special events like the Fourth of July.</li>
		<li>While most tourists hop on the T, Boston’s subway system, MBTA buses are often a more efficient way to get

			Faneuil Hall. </li>
