			<h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>To diversify your historical exploration, consider adding in some sites on the African American history
					trail
					in the Beacon Hill area.</li>
				<li>For a more exciting experience, plan to visit the Freedom Trail on a day when there are historical
					reenactments or special events like the Fourth of July.</li>
				<li>While most tourists hop on the T, Boston’s subway system, MBTA buses are often a more efficient way to
					get
					around downtown. Try out Bus 4 which loops around the North End.</li>
				<li>Research restaurants beforehand to avoid overpriced tourist traps. In particular, eat somewhere besides
					Faneuil Hall. </li>
				<li>Want more early U.S. history? Hop across the Charles River to Charlestown to see the USS Constitution
					and
					the
					Bunker Hill Monument. </li>
